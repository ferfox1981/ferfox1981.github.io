  description: I worked as tester in a Motorola project conducted by C.E.S.A.R. 
               My job was to find ways to "brake" the phones by writing feature integration tests.
               I was constantly in touch with the Urbana (Champaign, Illinois) team to synchronize the tests written by all of us. <br>

  description: I have been working with big batch processing in projects for the brazilian IRS (Receita Federal do Brasil). 
               There are massive amounts of data that have to be processed as fast as you can according to complex business rules.
               The complexity of those rules is related to tax law or revenue law that is always changing. I have also been working
               on migrating UIs of those systems from old platforms like Oracle Forms to moderm environments like JAVA (Backend) and Angular (Frontend) deploying them on the cloud. <br>
