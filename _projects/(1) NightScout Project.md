description: This is an interesting project. It's a fork of Nightscout Project (http://www.nightscout.info/), a project that has a goal to provide glucose information for users of many glucose metters that exist nowadays. I've done that fork for personal reasons because my mother is diabetic and was really excited to measure her glucose more frequently. This project is deployed on Heroku and now anyone can check my mom's glucose.
